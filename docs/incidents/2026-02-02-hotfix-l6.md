# Incident Post-Mortem: Hotfix L6

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Incident:** Networking Retry Loop & Swipe Regression

## Incident
Users experienced infinite loading loops when authentication failed (401), and accidental article opens when attempting to swipe/archive news cards.

## Impact
- **UX:** Frustrating swipe experience ("sticky taps").
- **Performance:** Potential battery drain and server load due to unthrottled retries on auth failure.
- **Reliability:** App state became unstable during network hiccups.

## Root Cause
1.  **Retry Logic:** Old fetcher treated all errors as retryable, creating loops on 401/403.
2.  **Gesture Conflict:** `onClick` fired even after `onDrag` events, interpreting swipes as clicks.

## Fix
Files modified:
- `src/lib/net/defensiveFetch.ts` (New Defensive Layer)
- `src/services/news/FeedManager.ts` (Integration)
- `src/components/views/SwipeableNewsCard.tsx` (Gesture Logic)
- `App.tsx`, `NetSimPanel.tsx` (Dev Tools)

## Prevention
1.  **Shell Syntax:** Use `;` instead of `&&` for Windows PowerShell compatibility in docs/scripts.
2.  **Dev Harming:** Always include a `NetSim` or similar harness to test edge cases locally.
3.  **Atomic Testing:** One change = One Test. Verify logic isolation (e.g., tap vs drag).
