=== DIAG CONCLUSION HINTS ===
If Studio works but pipeline FAIL(404): pipeline likely uses different project OR different region OR different credentials.
Compare project_detected + location_detected with Studio project/region.
If gemini-2.5-pro works but gemini-3-pro-preview fails: model not enabled/available in this project+region.
